Imps

Imps are the most common species of Helllanders present in underworld. They are red skinned, humanoid creatures, 110 centimeters (3â€™7 feet) tall on average, usually with a chubby build. They have hooves instead of feet, and small horns protruding from their heads. Their hair colour is limited to dark tones, ranging from dark blue to dark red.

Imps are the lowest creatures on the hells hierarchy, mainly due to their lack of strength or natural magical abilities. However despite that, imps flourish in the underworld, mainly because of their large numbers and their lack of pickiness. 

Imps highly value different jewelry, but what should be considered is that they care little about intricate carvings or designs but rather care about the sheer amount of precious metal. However very rarely an imp has enough wealth to afford golden accessory, so imps usually just dye copper, to make it look like gold or silver. Because of that if you meet an imp, they will most likely have a thick bracelet, which looks more like a shackle than an actual bracelet, on each hand, several necklaces, rings and sometimes even abaddons or diadems, all of those made from copper but covered in a thin layer of gold. 

Imps usually make lairs in simple caves, not even bothering to decorate them, and only keeping there what is necessary, like a pile of furs to sleep, plates, and vases with food.
