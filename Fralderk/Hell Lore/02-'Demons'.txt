“Demons”

The Underworld has many forms of life, but the one that will be covered here is the sentient one, or rather ones. 
Hell has four main races: Imps, Demons, Succubi and Royal demons. They all form a single nation commonly know as “Demons”, despite that already being the name of one of the races. For convenience, from now forth sentient inhabitants of underworld will be referred to as “Helllanders” to avoid confusion. 

Helllanders’ country is built on monarchy, previously being ruled by Deadwood Dynasty, and currently ruled by demon king Rithyenda.

Due to relatively small available area to inhabit, hell is very densely populated, and all of them share the same language. The only area which is isn’t densely inhabited is Everburning forests of Inferno.
