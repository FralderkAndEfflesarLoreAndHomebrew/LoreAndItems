Underworlds vegetation.

Vegetation is rare everywhere in the underworld, except the Great Everburning Forests of Inferno. Usually you will only find a few patches of moss, or a group of small bushes, around you, their red stems pushing through blackened stone. Hells plants look rather miserable. But do not let that deceive you, as they are incredibly dangerous.

First of all there is a species of moss, of dim red colour. At first glance it may seem like a regular moss, but if you step within 10 feet of it, it will become black and almost unnoticeable. And poor thing is whatever steps on the moss! It immediately will transform into giant mass of vines and biomass, enveloping the victim, and almost certainly killing it.

Another dangerous plant is Hellleaf, and it may just be one of the most terrifying things i have heard of. It looks like a small bush with big flat leaves. However the moment you touch that leaf, it bursts into a deadly white flame. That flame is incredibly dangerous and painful, yet it’s not the worst part. After fire damaged the victim’s flesh, thousands of unseeable spores are launched into the wound, causing long lasting damage, which is more often than not fatal.

And the third biggest danger is carnivorous plants. Carnivorous plants are not exclusively to the underworld, but the plants there are not only able to move, but are extremely quick, moving at the speeds such as 40 feet per second.
