The Underworld

Underworld, also commonly known as “Hell” is a plane of existence, and a terrifying one at that. A piece of scorching land, hidden in-between two presumably infinite chunks of land, one being the floor and other the roof. You will have trouble finding any liquid besides blood or flaming lava, and the terrain is rough and uneven, hills and pits making every step an imminent danger, although actual mountains are rare. 

Most of hell consists of uninhabitable desert, and only a large piece of land possesses any forms of life. 

If it wasn’t obvious already, temperatures in hell are extremely high, such that most creatures alien to it will have a hard time adapting. The center of habitable land is 40 degrees Celsius, and it only grows hotter from there. Outer edges of habitable land reach as hot as 80 degrees, and the temperature only rises as you venture into the desert. Fralderks secret information service, 1888 year.

“Demons”

The Underworld has many forms of life, but the one that will be covered here is the sentient one, or rather ones. 
Hell has four main races: Imps, Demons, Succubi and Royal demons. They all form a single nation commonly know as “Demons”, despite that already being the name of one of the races. For convenience, from now forth sentient inhabitants of underworld will be referred to as “Helllanders” to avoid confusion. 

Helllanders’ country is built on monarchy, previously being ruled by Deadwood Dynasty, and currently ruled by demon king Rithyenda.

Due to relatively small available area to inhabit, hell is very densely populated, and all of them share the same language. The only area which is isn’t densely inhabited is Everburning forests of Inferno. ‎<Сообщение изменено> Fralderks secret information service, 1888 year.

Imps

Imps are the most common species of Helllanders present in underworld. They are red skinned, humanoid creatures, 110 centimeters (3’7 feet) tall on average, usually with a chubby build. They have hooves instead of feet, and small horns protruding from their heads. Their hair colour is limited to dark tones, ranging from dark blue to dark red.

Imps are the lowest creatures on the hells hierarchy, mainly due to their lack of strength or natural magical abilities. However despite that, imps flourish in the underworld, mainly because of their large numbers and their lack of pickiness. 

Imps highly value different jewelry, but what should be considered is that they care little about intricate carvings or designs but rather care about the sheer amount of precious metal. However very rarely an imp has enough wealth to afford golden accessory, so imps usually just dye copper, to make it look like gold or silver. Because of that if you meet an imp, they will most likely have a thick bracelet, which looks more like a shackle than an actual bracelet, on each hand, several necklaces, rings and sometimes even abaddons or diadems, all of those made from copper but covered in a thin layer of gold. 

Imps usually make lairs in simple caves, not even bothering to decorate them, and only keeping there what is necessary, like a pile of furs to sleep, plates, and vases with food. Fralderks secret information service, 1888 year.

Demons

Demons are the second most common race among helllanders. They have red skin, are usually slightly shorter than a human, and are incredibly muscular, even females. They have sharp claws on both arms and legs, and curving horns, akin to the ones of mountain goats. Their hair is either raven black, or the colour of the obsidian, although many demons prefer to be bald.

Demons by nature, are cruel and barbaric, and even though they poses a certain level of intelligence, they prefer bot to use it. 

Among demons, brute strength is valued greatly, with many fighting among each other with no purpose, but to prove themselves. Demons value jewelry as well, but not the one made of precious metals, but rather their crude trophies made of flesh and bones of defeated enemies, not for aesthetic reasons, but to show off. Most of the furniture, and eating utensils are made from bone as well. 

Demons usually build simple houses from stone, making sure to stick as much sharpened bones between the rocks as they can. Some of the more influential demons even build their whole houses from bone. It’s also common among demon not to just, not clean themselves, but even intentionally cover their clothes and houses in blood. 

Another thing valued by demons is weapons. Even though usually they resemble a barbaric tribe, everything changes then weapons are discussed. If the demon is able to create weapons, capable of inflicting much pain and harm, they will be respected. Fralderks secret information service, 1888 year.

Succubi/Incubi

Succubi are much less numerous than other helllanders, but still are relatively common in the underworld. They form a more civilized part of hell, being much less barbaric than demons or imps. 

Succubi are humanoid creatures, usually the height of an elf. They have red skin, long, slightly curved horns, hooves instead of feet and large webbed wings. They are able to change their appearance, shaping their body as they will, however they will always retain their red skin and horns. They are able to change their hair colour and we have been unable to collect information about their natural hair colour. 

While physically weaker than demons, succubi have natural proficiency in magic.

Succubi’s ability to change their physical looks at will, takes a great part in their culture. Because in a sense none of succubi are unique, they make up for it with their clothing. Despite what one might expect, succubi always have lush, layered clothing, which they try to make as unique as possible, often so at their own discomfort. Their clothes vary in colors, often have decorations out of different metals, and sometimes even mithril, magical dyes are also highly valued.

Succubi are highly social creatures, holding frequent balls, usually hosted by their leader - high demon Alanel-ku.

(P.S. All of this applies to Incubi as well, it’s just that I did not feel lime writing “succubi/incubi” every time) Fralderks secret information service, 1888 year.

Royal demons

Before current demon king, Rithyenda, captured the throne, underworld was ruled by the Dead Wood Dynasty. People of which, varied from other demons, and therefor were called “Royal Demons” and are considered a separate race. 

Royal demons are the most ‘humane’ in their appearance among all helllanders.
They have a pale, almost white skin, long slightly curved horns, and thick scaly tails. Their height is similar to that of a human. 

Not much is known about their culture, as royal customs were not public, during their reign. 

There’s information that upon capturing the throne Rithyenda, attempted to hunt down the remnants of Deadwood dynasty. It is unknown whether there are any survivors.

(P.S. I didn’t write much here, since I kinda think, then I would be invading Alastor’s backstory)

The Great Everburning Forests of Inferno.

They say you can endlessly watch a flame dance inside of a campfire, seemingly so frail, yet providing warmth and comfort. Now imagine an entire forest ablaze, everything burning, wherever your gaze can land there is fiery light. It is a majestic spectacle. Yet, after some time the fire dies out. And then… there is nothing behind, only ash and scorched earth, a cruel reminder of the liveliness the place once possessed.

But could you imagine if a forest fire never stopped? An endless flicker of flames, bringing not death and despair, but warmth and life to the trees burning? Everything around you, is in gorgeous hues of orange and red. It’s like the whole world around you is celebrating something. Celebrating with all of it’s passion, all of it’s fury, all of it’s soul. Most of people will never experience something like that.


The great everburning forest of inferno is an enormous forest on the southern side of underworld’s habitable lands. It is the only large forest in hell, and consists of unique trees, which require enormous heat to sustain themselves. As far as we know the trees harvest hell’s vast amount of chaotic magic and turn it into a flame burning within the tree’s crown. The temperatures there reach incredibly high ranging from just 200 degrees to 1435 degrees celsius, making it uninhabitable even for most species of the underworld.

Underworlds vegetation.

Vegetation is rare everywhere in the underworld, except the Great Everburning Forests of Inferno. Usually you will only find a few patches of moss, or a group of small bushes, around you, their red stems pushing through blackened stone. Hells plants look rather miserable. But do not let that deceive you, as they are incredibly dangerous.

First of all there is a species of moss, of dim red colour. At first glance it may seem like a regular moss, but if you step within 10 feet of it, it will become black and almost unnoticeable. And poor thing is whatever steps on the moss! It immediately will transform into giant mass of vines and biomass, enveloping the victim, and almost certainly killing it.

Another dangerous plant is Hellleaf, and it may just be one of the most terrifying things i have heard of. It looks like a small bush with big flat leaves. However the moment you touch that leaf, it bursts into a deadly white flame. That flame is incredibly dangerous and painful, yet it’s not the worst part. After fire damaged the victim’s flesh, thousands of unseeable spores are launched into the wound, causing long lasting damage, which is more often than not fatal.

And the third biggest danger is carnivorous plants. Carnivorous plants are not exclusively to the underworld, but the plants there are not only able to move, but are extremely quick, moving at the speeds such as 40 feet per second.
