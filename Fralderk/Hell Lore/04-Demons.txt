Demons

Demons are the second most common race among helllanders. They have red skin, are usually slightly shorter than a human, and are incredibly muscular, even females. They have sharp claws on both arms and legs, and curving horns, akin to the ones of mountain goats. Their hair is either raven black, or the colour of the obsidian, although many demons prefer to be bald.

Demons by nature, are cruel and barbaric, and even though they poses a certain level of intelligence, they prefer bot to use it. 

Among demons, brute strength is valued greatly, with many fighting among each other with no purpose, but to prove themselves. Demons value jewelry as well, but not the one made of precious metals, but rather their crude trophies made of flesh and bones of defeated enemies, not for aesthetic reasons, but to show off. Most of the furniture, and eating utensils are made from bone as well. 

Demons usually build simple houses from stone, making sure to stick as much sharpened bones between the rocks as they can. Some of the more influential demons even build their whole houses from bone. Itâ€™s also common among demon not to just, not clean themselves, but even intentionally cover their clothes and houses in blood. 

Another thing valued by demons is weapons. Even though usually they resemble a barbaric tribe, everything changes then weapons are discussed. If the demon is able to create weapons, capable of inflicting much pain and harm, they will be respected.
