The Underworld

Underworld, also commonly known as “Hell” is a plane of existence, and a terrifying one at that. A piece of scorching land, hidden in-between two presumably infinite chunks of land, one being the floor and other the roof. You will have trouble finding any liquid besides blood or flaming lava, and the terrain is rough and uneven, hills and pits making every step an imminent danger, although actual mountains are rare. 

Most of hell consists of uninhabitable desert, and only a large piece of land possesses any forms of life. 

If it wasn’t obvious already, temperatures in hell are extremely high, such that most creatures alien to it will have a hard time adapting. The center of habitable land is 40 degrees Celsius, and it only grows hotter from there. Outer edges of habitable land reach as hot as 80 degrees, and the temperature only rises as you venture into the desert.
