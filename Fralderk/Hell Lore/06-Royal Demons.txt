Royal demons

Before current demon king, Rithyenda, captured the throne, underworld was ruled by the Dead Wood Dynasty. People of which, varied from other demons, and therefor were called “Royal Demons” and are considered a separate race. 

Royal demons are the most ‘humane’ in their appearance among all helllanders.
They have a pale, almost white skin, long slightly curved horns, and thick scaly tails. Their height is similar to that of a human. 

Not much is known about their culture, as royal customs were not public, during their reign. 

There’s information that upon capturing the throne Rithyenda, attempted to hunt down the remnants of Deadwood dynasty. It is unknown whether there are any survivors.

(P.S. I didn’t write much here, since I kinda think, then I would be invading Alastor’s backstory)
