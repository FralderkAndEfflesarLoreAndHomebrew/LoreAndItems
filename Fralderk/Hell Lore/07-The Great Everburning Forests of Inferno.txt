The Great Everburning Forests of Inferno.

They say you can endlessly watch a flame dance inside of a campfire, seemingly so frail, yet providing warmth and comfort. Now imagine an entire forest ablaze, everything burning, wherever your gaze can land there is fiery light. It is a majestic spectacle. Yet, after some time the fire dies out. And then… there is nothing behind, only ash and scorched earth, a cruel reminder of the liveliness the place once possessed.

But could you imagine if a forest fire never stopped? An endless flicker of flames, bringing not death and despair, but warmth and life to the trees burning? Everything around you, is in gorgeous hues of orange and red. It’s like the whole world around you is celebrating something. Celebrating with all of it’s passion, all of it’s fury, all of it’s soul. Most of people will never experience something like that.


The great everburning forest of inferno is an enormous forest on the southern side of underworld’s habitable lands. It is the only large forest in hell, and consists of unique trees, which require enormous heat to sustain themselves. As far as we know the trees harvest hell’s vast amount of chaotic magic and turn it into a flame burning within the tree’s crown. The temperatures there reach incredibly high ranging from just 200 degrees to 1435 degrees celsius, making it uninhabitable even for most species of the underworld.
