Succubi/Incubi

Succubi are much less numerous than other helllanders, but still are relatively common in the underworld. They form a more civilized part of hell, being much less barbaric than demons or imps. 

Succubi are humanoid creatures, usually the height of an elf. They have red skin, long, slightly curved horns, hooves instead of feet and large webbed wings. They are able to change their appearance, shaping their body as they will, however they will always retain their red skin and horns. They are able to change their hair colour and we have been unable to collect information about their natural hair colour. 

While physically weaker than demons, succubi have natural proficiency in magic.

Succubi’s ability to change their physical looks at will, takes a great part in their culture. Because in a sense none of succubi are unique, they make up for it with their clothing. Despite what one might expect, succubi always have lush, layered clothing, which they try to make as unique as possible, often so at their own discomfort. Their clothes vary in colors, often have decorations out of different metals, and sometimes even mithril, magical dyes are also highly valued.

Succubi are highly social creatures, holding frequent balls, usually hosted by their leader - high demon Alanel-ku.

(P.S. All of this applies to Incubi as well, it’s just that I did not feel lime writing “succubi/incubi” every time)
